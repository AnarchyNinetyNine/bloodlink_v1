# Getting Started

Welcome to the project! This application is built using ['Next.js'](https://nextjs.org), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- ['Node.js'](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- ['npm'](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or ['yarn'](https://yarnpkg.com/) / ['pnpm'](https://pnpm.io/) / ['bun'](https://bun.sh/)

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnarchyNinetyNine/bloodlink_v1
cd bloodlink_v1
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Running the Development Server

Start the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Now, open ['http://localhost:3000'](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app. The page will auto-update as you make changes to the code.

# Available Pages

Here are the available pages in the application:

## 1. Home Page (`/`)
The landing page of the application. This page provides an introduction and access to key areas of the app.

## 2. Donor Account Sign-Up (`/donor/account/sign-up`)
A registration page for new donors. On this page, users can create an account by providing their details.

## 3. Donor Account Sign-In (`/donor/account/sign-in`)
An authentication page for existing users to log in using their credentials. After successful sign-in, users can access their dashboard and other features.

## 4. Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
The central hub where authenticated users can view and manage their account settings, donations, and other activities. This page requires users to be logged in.

# Development Tips

## Hot Reloading
The development server supports hot reloading, which means any changes you make to the code will automatically be reflected in the browser without the need for a manual refresh.

## Font Optimization
This project uses the `next/font` feature to automatically optimize and load the Geist font, improving performance and user experience.

---

# Customizing the Project

## Pages
You can start editing the pages by modifying the corresponding files in the `app` directory (e.g., `app/page.tsx` for the homepage).

## Styles
Modify the styling as needed in the `styles` directory to change the look and feel of the application.

## Components
Custom components can be added to the `components` directory for reuse throughout the app.
